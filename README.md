# Hack Story: “Monsoon Rush: The Storm, the Signal, and the Last‑Mile”

Fabrikam is a global lifestyle brand that designs and manufactures outerwear and athleisure. They sell athleisure through their retail stores. As the monsoon intensifies , some celebrities athlete post surprise video wearing Fabrikam's apparel. Instantly, clickstream traffic explodes, add‑to‑carts spike, and store associates report low visibility into real-time operations during this rush hours.
At the same time:
	• A tropical depression shifts course, threatening ports and highway corridors.
	• A key fabric supplier reports a loom vibration anomaly; quality telemetry shows rising defect probability.
	• Carriers update ETAs showing delays of orders.

Fabrikam needs real‑time intelligence to sense demand, protect availability, and fulfill promises—or they’ll face stockouts, cancellations, and reputational damage.
## Your mission (as hack teams): 
Fuse high‑velocity signals from manufacturing, retail, e‑commerce clickstream, weather, and logistics to drive actionable insights that keep promises to customers—even as conditions change minute‑by‑minute.
## Why Fabric RTI? 
It gives you a single place for data in motion (Real‑Time Hub + Eventstream) plus analyze/visualize/act primitives (Eventhouse/KQL, Real‑Time Dashboards, and Activator) so teams can build end‑to‑end, from sensor to business outcome, on one SaaS platform.

## What “success” looks like (business KPIs to aim for)
	1. Stop the shipping provider that is carrying the highest defect probability product.
 	2. You are able to pinpoint which apparel has highest demand using clickstream data.

## The data you’ll have (live or simulated)
	• Manufacturing telemetry (per line/machine): status, OEE, defect signals, vibration, temp, runtime, SKU run, shift.
	• Retail/Store: POS sales ticks, on‑hand corrections, footfall, shelf gap events.
	• E‑commerce clickstream: page views, add‑to‑cart, checkout intent, abandonment, geo, referral.
	• Weather: cell‑level nowcast & alerts (rainfall intensity, wind, flood warning).
	• Shipment/Logistics: carrier milestones, GPS pings, ETA deltas, exceptions.

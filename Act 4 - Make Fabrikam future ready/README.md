# Make Fabrikam future ready

## Backstory
Now that you have setup Fabrikam for success, next step is to make it future ready so that Fabrikam is outperforming its competitors in the fashion industry. We want to forecast defect probability so that production can be adjusted accordingly. We also want to setup anomaly detection so that any abnormal vibration can be detected early and necessary actions can be taken to avoid defective products. Agents will help Fabrikam's management to get real-time insights on production and shipment.

## Setup
For running this Act, 
1. You will need access to create Data Agents and AI Anomaly detector. 
2. You will need knowledge of Kusto Query Language (KQL) to analyze the data.

## Challenges 

# Setup Data Agent with Real-Time Intelligence
    
    Hint : Connect with all main tables of Eventhouse 
Find out the following details from AgentS
1. What is the most popular product?
2. Which website redirected the highest traffic?

## Abnormal vibrations are causing high defects. Setup AI Anomaly Detector
    Hint: Use vibration column by siteId and timestamp

## Setup forecast of defect probability on temperature 
    Hint: Use  forecasting capability of KQL
